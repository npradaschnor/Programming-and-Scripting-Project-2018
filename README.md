# Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2018
The project entails you researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the Python programming language based on that research. An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated and written about it previously, and many of those are not experienced programmers. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. 
You might do that for this project as follows:
[X]. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
[ ]. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
[ ]. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
[ ]. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
[ ]. Write a summary of your investigations.
[ ]. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

## About Iris Dataset
The iris data set was and collected by Edgar Anderson (1935)  and it contains data with 150 random samples of flowers of 50 samples from each of three species of irises (*setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*). Two parts of the flower were measured: sepal and pedal (lenght and width of each part in cm, total of four features). Therefore, there are 5 attributes in the data base: sepal lenght in cm, sepal widht in cm, petal lenght in cm, petal width in cm and class - *iris setosa*, *iris versicolor* and *iris virginica*.  This data set was used by Ronald Fisher (1936) formultiple measurements introducing linear-discriminant-function technique [1,2,4,5].
The Iris data set is a multivariate data set and it is a best known and understood dataset and one of the most used to analyse data sets in statistics, data visualization, machine learning, etc. It is available in CSV format at Central Michigan University - CMU website (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu) [3, 5].
